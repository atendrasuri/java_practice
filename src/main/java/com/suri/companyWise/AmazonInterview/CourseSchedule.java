 * @Creation-Date: 13/10/19
 * @Description: (Overwrite)
 * 1. Please describe the business usage of the class.
 * 2. Please describe the technical usage of the class.
 * @History: There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.
 * <p>
 * Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
 * <p>
 * Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: 2, [[1,0]]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
 * To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
 * To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
 * also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
 * You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
